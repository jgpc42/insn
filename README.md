### What is it?

This library provides a functional abstraction over [ASM][asm] for generating JVM bytecode. ASM is the library that Clojure itself uses to dynamically compile Clojure code into code that can be run on the JVM.

### Quick start

Let's begin by creating a simple class, equivalent to the following Java code.

```java
package my.pkg;

public class Adder {
    public static int VALUE = 42;
    public long add (int n) {
        return (long) (VALUE + n);
    }
}
```

The class is specified as a map. The class fields and methods are sequences of maps giving the members of said class.

```clojure
(def class-data
  {:name 'my.pkg.Adder
   :fields [{:flags #{:public :static}, :name "VALUE", :type :int, :value 42}]
   :methods [{:flags #{:public}, :name "add", :desc [:int :long]
              :emit [[:getstatic :this "VALUE" :int]
                     [:iload 1]
                     [:iadd]
                     [:i2l]
                     [:lreturn]]}]})
```

Above, we described in data the same information expressed by the Java code, except the method body was given as a sequence of bytecode instructions. (Note: unlike Java, the method return value is specified via the `:desc` key as the last element). If you aren't fluent in JVM bytecode instruction syntax, I would suggest reading chapter 3 of the excellent tutorial pdf from the ASM [site][pdf].

`:emit` can also be a fn that is passed the ASM `MethodVisitor` object to write the method bytecode as shown in [this example][emitfn].

Now to write the bytecode.

```clojure
(require '[insn.core :as insn])

(def result (insn/visit class-data))
```

The `result` is a map containing the generated class's packaged-prefixed `:name` and `:bytes`, the latter being a byte array. This information is all you need to give to a ClassLoader to define your class.

For convenience, we can use `insn.core/define` to define the class for us.

```clojure
(def class-object (insn/define class-data)) ;; => my.pkg.Adder
(-> class-object .newInstance (.add 17))    ;; => 59
```

Note that you can also pass `result` to `define`, the class will not be regenerated. Also note, like Java, since we did not define any constructors, a public no-argument constructor that simply calls the superclass constructor was generated for us.

If you are evaluating the code snippets above in the REPL, you can also just do:

```clojure
(.add (my.pkg.Adder.) 17) ;; => 59
```

Since, by default, `define` loads the class using Clojure's own `DynamicClassLoader`, meaning the class will be *first class* to subsequent evaluations in the running Clojure environment.

### More information

For additional usage examples and topics, see the [wiki][wiki]. For a complete reference, see the [docs][doc]. The fairly comprehensive [test suite][tests] is also demonstrative and should be easy to follow.

### Running the tests

```bash
lein test
```

Or, `lein test-all` for all supported Clojure versions.

The tests can also be run against all supported Java versions (via [`docker`][docker]) with:

``` bash
./test-all-jdk.sh
```
